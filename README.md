# Independent-Projects

FRONT-END:

Progression Report:

This README will be used to help document me progress as well as challenges with this project.
I am using next.js as my framework. This is new to me, but I want to challenge myself and see how well next.js does. I have heard great things about it since CRA is slowly being removed. First challenge I already experienced with installation was the import aliases. I had to do research on what that was exactly and was able to overcome it by adding @components/*
I installed Tailwind.CSS as well. Other dependencies I used were axios, react-redux, react icons.
As I began to learn how to use tailwind, I ran into issues with not having the css populating. I made the mistake of deleting the globals.css import on my app.js when I was removing the boilerplate code. It took me about an hour to troubleshoot.

Steps to start project:

1. cd into ~/social-media-site/frontend-ui/client-facing
2. Run npm run dev
3. Open browser to localhost:3000/
