Progression Report:

- This README will be used to help document me progress as well as challenges with this project.
- Using next.js as my framework. This is new to me but I want to challenge myself and see how well next.js does. I have heard
  great things about since CRA is slowly being removed.
- First challenge I already experienced with installation was the import aliases. I had to do research on what that was exactly and able to overcome it by adding @components/\*
- I will be intalling Tailwind.CSS as well.
